# SimpleHUB 1.0.0
Customizable StreamElements-based alert HUB for your streams. 

## How To Use It
Paste the code into specific Overlay elements.

> **static**
> Background element. Created with "Custom Widget".

> **dynamic**
> Alerts covering the background element. Use default "AlertBox" and modify alerts according to the specific folders.

There is no overlapping image provided as you can simply add your own logo in the StreamElements editor.

## Version Log
**1.0.0** - version directly from my streams with additional option to use Tip/Donation alerts. Not much in the way of customization.

## Development Plan
